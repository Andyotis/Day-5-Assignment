1. How Does Understanding Your Audience’s Expertise Shape Technical Information?
-Tech Experts: Use precise terminology, focus on efficiency, provide in-depth technical details.
-Non-Experts: Use plain language, provide explanations with analogies, focus on usability and benefits.
For example, explaining cloud storage:
•	To experts: "Utilizes distributed computing to manage data redundancy across multiple nodes."
•	To general users: "Your files are backed up online, so you can access them from any device."
